# Imperative paradigm

## Overview

The imperative paradigm is probably the fundamental way of writing code, by
simply making statements of what the program should do in simple and clear
operations: assign this variable, evaluate this mathematical expression,
delete this piece of memory, etc.

## Components

The most basic part of software code is the instruction, which is usually one
line, one expression, one call to do something.

Examples:
* assign a variable
* perform an arithmetic operation
* evaluate a logic (boolean) expression
* allocate/deallocate a space of memory
* read from an input
* write to an output

Instructions can be grouped in sequences that execute one after another in
orderly fashion.
