# Bit field operations

## Overview

These kind of operations and algorithms are necessary for a number of
applications:
* device drivers
* low-level graphics
* communications protocols
* packet assembly
* encoding/decoding
* cryptography
* compression
* faster/optimised algorithms (like the inverse square root)
