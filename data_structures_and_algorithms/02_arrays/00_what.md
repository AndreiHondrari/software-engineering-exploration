# arrayz
static
dynamic

ITERATE
--------------
multiple elements at a time

INSERT
--------------
* dynamic - easy
* static - uhm reconstruct ?

Ways
* one element at beginning
* one element at end
* one element at offset (from beg)
* multiple elements at beginning
* multiple elements at end
* multiple elements at offset (from beg)

EXTRACT
--------------
* extract one -easy for both
* extract multiple from beginning
* extract multiple from end
* extract multiple from offset
* odds and evens
* every nth element
* every nth element that matches criteria
* according to list of indexes
* according to fixed pattern

COUNT
--------------
* amount of elements
* count specific value
* count elements that pass a criteria
* count multiple values
* count elements a followed by elements b at offset from each other

CHECK
--------------
* if adjacent two elements are according to comparison
* if groups of values at different offsets are according to comparison

COMPARE
--------------
* against another array if it is equal
* against another array if all the values are greater/lesser

REMOVE
--------------
* in static, we must recreate
* single value
* multiple values from beginning
* multiple values from end
* multiple values from offset

CHANGE / OVERWRITE
--------------
* intersect with another array from first
* intersect with another array from last
* intersect with another array from offset from first

RE-ORDER
--------------
* swap single elements
* swap halves
* swap groups of elements
* sort
* reverse
* scramble

FIND / SEARCH
--------------
* specific value exists
* value exists according to criteria
* sub-sequence
* first match
* list of indexes of multiple matches

FILTER
--------------
* according to single criteria
* according to multiple criteria

MAP
--------------
* transform all values with operation

REDUCE
--------------
* reduce all values into a single value

GENERATE
--------------

MERGE
--------------

CONCATENATE
--------------

DECOMPOSE / SPLIT
--------------
* in halves
* in n-plets
* in odds vs evens
* in complementary patterns (like 00100101 with 11011010)

IMPRINT
--------------
