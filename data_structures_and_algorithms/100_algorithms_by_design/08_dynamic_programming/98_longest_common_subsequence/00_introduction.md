# Longest Common Subsequence

## Overview

Given two sequences, find the longest common subsequence.

## Example

- sequence 1: `A B C D`
- sequence 2: `X A B D`

The longest common subsequence is: A B D (length 3)

**Observation:** notice that the resulting sequence is not formed out of the
immediate adjacent items, but can be any item as long as they are in order
according to the original sequence.
